# Edge-Detection
Edge Detection project by using OpenCV and numpy libraries in python.

## Canny Detection Algorithm
The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works.
### Canny Edge detection is an Algorithm consisting of 4 major steps:
1.Image Smoothing     
2.Differentiation    
3.Non-maximum Suppression       
4.Edge Thresholding
## Libraries Required
- Python 2.7.x version      
* OpenCV 2.7.x or 3.1.0 version      
+ numpy
